# Android Imbed

Uses a [WebView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html) to show local html in the native app. Then call Java code from Javascript and vice versa.

## Features
* WebView is full screen (no title bar)
* Android Back button goes back in WebView
* Loads local html in /assets folder
* Allows visiting links to external urls in a new browser window (outside app)

## TODO
* Build Java <-> Javascript bridge (at least examples)
